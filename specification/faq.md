# FAQ: Frequently Answered Questions

__Isn't this section normally called Frequenly _Asked_ Questions?__

Probably. I don't know. People alsways just call it _FAQ_. This file was started before anyone had a change to ask me any quiestions about this specification and as such calling this section _Frequenly Asked Questions_ would have just been wrong. (Yes, I _can_ give the answers without the questions being asked!)

__Is the file format called _List-of-Lines_ just so you can use the file extension `.lol`?__

Maybe? Would you get angry, if I said yes?
