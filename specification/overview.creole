= Overview

**List of Lines** (**LOL**) is a bit of a misnomer for this specification as an //LOL file// can be used to specify much more than just lines. It can be used to describe [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyhedron.html|polyhedra]] (generalization of polygons for any number of dimensions) embedded into 0- to 3-dimensional space, grouped into layers.

The definition used for these polyhedra is not constrained by the number of dimensions that are used to represent the coordinates of their vertices and neither does the file format defined by this specification. However, this version of the specification only allows a number of dimensions from 0 up to 3.

A 0-dimensional polyhedron can be used to basically specify a boolean value, which sometimes is useful when working with algorithms that work in any number of dimensions. A 1-dimensional polyhedron can be used to specify open and closed intervals on the number line. A 2-dimensional polyhedron can describe one or multiple polygons on the plane. And a 3-dimensional polyhedron is just that, a polyhedron in 3-dimensional space, i.e. any volume or non-volume that can be built up from points, line segments, triangles and tetrahedrons.

The specific type of polyhedra that can be represented are called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nef_polygon|Nef polyhedra]]. These polyhedra allow for example to specify 3-dimensional objects without a volume. Thus we can distinguish the volume inside of a cube from the infinitely thin shell of the cube. We can also represent the lines between the corners or just the corner points, or any combination representable by set operations, with these polyhedra.

An LOL file may contain multiple polyhedra (or even none). All polyhedra in the same file use the same coordinate system (and thus must use the same number of dimensions). These polyhedron have a defined order and each one is given a distinct name, which is just a string. Thus they work much the same as "layers" in most graphics applications. The polyhedra do not need to correlate to each other and may overlap, but are interpreted as occupying the same "canvas" by an application reading such an LOL file.
